    <h1>Trevor Bauer loses tough game</h1>

    <article>
      <p>The Dodgers co-ace lost another tough game last night, giving up two solo
      home runs to the Houston Astros. The Dodgers offense once again could not
      muster a lot of runs, something that frequently happens when Bauer takes
      the mound.</p>

      <p>Bauer gave up solo homeruns to Jose Altuve and George Bregman and exited 
        the game having thrown 100 pitches. The fiery right hander ended with a 
        respectable statline of 6 IP, 4 H, 2 R, and 3 strikeouts. The Dodgers'
        winning streak ended at 8.

      <h2>Los Angeles Clippers in deep trouble</h2>

      <p>The Clippers did themselves no favors after last week's debacle which saw
      them lose games deliberately to OKC and Houston. It was all part of a 
      grand master plan to avoid the cross-town Lakers. Instead the Clippers
      got a first round date with a familiar foe, the Dallas Mavericks. 
      And after watching the first two games, it seems that the strategy has 
      backfired. Big time.
